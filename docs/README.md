## Key Architecture Decisions

### Technology Choices

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Smart Contracts** | Solidity + Diamond Standard | Upgradeable, modular contracts with gas efficiency |
| **Frontend** | React 18 + TypeScript + Viem | Type-safe, performant Web3 integration |
| **Backend** | Node.js + GraphQL + PostgreSQL | Scalable API with flexible querying |
| **Infrastructure** | Kubernetes + AWS | Cloud-native with auto-scaling capabilities |
| **Blockchain** | Ethereum + Polygon + Arbitrum | Multi-chain for cost optimization |

### Architecture Patterns

- **Microservices Architecture**: Independently deployable services for scalability
- **Event-Driven Design**: Asynchronous processing with message queues
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read/write models for optimal performance
- **Diamond Standard**: Upgradeable smart contracts with unlimited functionality
- **Multi-Layer Security**: Defense in depth across all system components

## Development Workflow

### Smart Contract Development
```bash
# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests with gas reporting
npx hardhat test --gas-reporter

# Deploy to testnet
npx hardhat deploy --network goerli

# Verify contracts
npx hardhat verify DEPLOYED_ADDRESS --network goerli
```

### Application Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Infrastructure Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to staging
kubectl apply -f k8s/staging/

# Deploy to production
helm upgrade --install verypay ./helm/verypay

# Monitor deployment
kubectl get pods -n verypay-api
```
